#ALX Load balancer project.
##in this project:
we are tasked with creating a load balancer that will distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers.
This will help ensure that no single server bears too much demand.
In this project, we will implement a round-robin algorithm to distribute client requests across multiple servers.
